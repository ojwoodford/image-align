This repository contains the MATLAB code required to reproduce the results in the paper: 

## [Least Squares Normalized Cross Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04320)

To run, call:

    startup();
    run_all(RESULTS_DIR);

Requirements:

 - A C++ compiler set up (`mex -setup C++`). The script automatically compiles necessary C++ code.
 - An internet connection. The script automatically downloads the required data.
 - Ghostscipt be installed. The script automatically generates PDFs of the graphs in the paper.

A complete run through all experiments takes around 12 hours on a 48-core
machine.
